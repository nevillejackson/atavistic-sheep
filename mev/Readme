This directory contains the 'evolution paper' latex source files, and their
translation to *.pdf files.

This is the original 1988 document written in Latex2e.
None of the Journal referees changes have been included.

The *.tex files are Unix text files (ie linefeed but no carriage return).

The images are in ./images.
The *.tif files are the images as scanned.
The *.png files are the images converted to .png files (Portable Network Graphics)
   for use with latex.
