# atavistic-sheep #
This project is about the recurring incidence of individuals with primitive sheep characteristics in Australian Merino sheep flocks. Why does it occur? There is no accepted mechanism in quantitative genetics to explain why a purebred domesticated population would revert toward its wild ancestors. 

## Data showing the incidence of neo-primitive sheep in Merino flocks ##
There is a manuscript ( see the evol.pdf file in the _projectname/mev_ directory) which was written in 1989 and has remained unpublished. It shows that neo-primitive individuals occur in some Merino stud flocks, in some selection experiments, and in unselected flocks. It is generally accepted among Australian Merino breeders that a flock will decline in productivity and wool quality, if it is not culled at all, or if it is selected in an inappropriate manner.
The practice of _rogueing_ is an accepted procedure among plant breeders.
It would seem that practical breeders accept atavism, but geneticists have a problem with the concept.

##Is this a Merino-sheep-specific phenomenon or a universal phenomenon? ##
We would welcome communication from anyone who has observed this phenomenon in other domesticated species.  What do breeders of other domesticated species think would happen under an inappropriate selection regime, and is it  a movement in the direction of their wild ancestors?

The phenomenon was known to Darwin
'.. our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms.'
[ Origin of Species, Chapter I, page 37 ]

## Possible explanations ##
* A major gene segregating in Merino flocks
* Migration - that is introgression of the Merino with genetic material from other breeds
* Canalisation of development being stronger in the wild type than in domesticated populations
* Something special about the sheep's fleece and fitness, possibly involving birthcoats
* Phenodeviants or developmental noise
* Dominance can explain simple one-locus cases of reversion or atavism
 

## How can you help? ##
If you have an opinion or some data or some ideas on a genetic basis for this phenomenon, please submit a _pull request_. We would like to assemble a collection of data, breeder experience, and possible genetic explanations.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
In one word, an explanation. Any unexplained phenomenon is a challenge. We need a theory of the quantitative genetics of extreme individuals.
