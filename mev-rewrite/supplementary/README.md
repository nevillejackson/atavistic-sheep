# Supplementary documents #
In order to properly complete this rewrite a number of critical issues needed to be resolved. This is being done as some additional studies, each documented in the subdirectories listed below

## Additional material ##
* primitive subdir - sorting out which characteristics are indicative of a recurrence of ancestral or primitive attributes.
* cwwcomponents subdir - rewriting the equations for components of clean wool weight to show that variance of fibre diameter is a component, and that diameters of primary and secondary fibres contribute separately to this variance.
* genetic-parameters - parameter estimates relevant to those traits of Merino sheep which exhibit atavism.
