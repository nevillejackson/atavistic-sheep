\section{Introduction} 
In the document Jackson etal(1990)~\cite{jack:90} some genetic parameter estimates were presented ( see Table 8 of Jackson etal(1990)~\cite{jack:90}) for diameters of primary and secondary fibres and a number of  other important wool characteristics. These were preliminary estimates obtained by the now outdated analysis of variance method for partitioning variances between and within half-sib families. 

A modern method of obtaining these parameters would be to estimate additive genetic variance components using maximum likelihood methods and incorating the full additive genetic relationship matrix  among all individuals, computed from a pedigree going back to the base generation of the flock. 

This analysis has been done on the exact same dataset for a comprehensive set of 48 traits (Jackson (2015)~\cite{jack:15}). What we present here is parameter estimates for a small subset of these traits which are relevant to the issues of Merino evolution and atavism.

\section{Materials and methods}
The sheep and measurements were as described in Jackson (2015)~\cite{jack:15}.
\subsection{Traits}
The subset of traits covered here are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:traits}
\input{tabtraits.tex}

\subsection{Statistical Methods}
The statistical techniques used for estimation of parameters for these data are covered in Jackson (2015)~\cite{jack:15}.  The software used is called {\em dmm}, which runs as a package under the R statistical language ~\cite{}. {\em dmm} is documented in a user's guide (Jackson(2015b)~\cite{jack:15b}).
